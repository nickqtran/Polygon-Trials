POLYGONS IN SPACE

A 2D arcade-style space shooter built using a custom JavaScript game engine. The player controls a spaceship, shoots asteroids, collects coins, and tries to achieve the highest score possible before colliding with an asteroid.

This project was developed as the final project for CSCI2510 - Introduction to Game Programming.
